---

### **üíª Manual Install (Advanced Users)**

If you prefer to install manually or already have Python set up:

#### **macOS / Linux**

```bash
pip install pybricksdev
# or
pip3 install pybricksdev

# Verify installation
pybricksdev --version
```

**Troubleshooting macOS:**
- If `pip` is not found, install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- If you get permission errors, use: `pip install --user pybricksdev`
- If command not found after install, add to PATH:
  ```bash
  export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.x/bin:$PATH"
  ```
  (Add this line to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile` to make it permanent)

#### **Windows**

```cmd
pip install pybricksdev
# or
python -m pip install pybricksdev

# Verify installation
pybricksdev --version
```

**Troubleshooting Windows:**
- If `pip` is not found, install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- If you get permission errors, try running Command Prompt as Administrator
- If command not found after install, add Python Scripts folder to PATH:
  - Search for "Environment Variables" in Windows
  - Add `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3x\Scripts` to PATH

---

### **Verify Bluetooth Connectivity**

After installing pybricksdev, test if your hub is detected:

```bash
pybricksdev devices
```

This should list your SPIKE Prime or other LEGO hubs if they're turned on and Bluetooth is enabled.

[![Install from Open VSX](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenVSX-Pybricks--Runner-blue)](https://open-vsx.org/extension/AnandSingh/pybricks-runner)


### Manual Installing for development

1. Clone or download this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pybricks-runner-vscode.git
```

2. Open the folder in VSCode:

```bash
cd pybricks-runner-vscode
code .
```

3. Install dependencies and package the extension:

```bash
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
npm install
vsce package
```

4. Install as below 
```
code --install-extension pybricks-runner-<version>.vsix
```

Or Install the `.vsix` extension file from VSCode:
   - Open VSCode
   - Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
   - Click on `...` and select "Install from VSIX"
   - Select the generated `.vsix` file

---

## Usage

- Open a Python (`.py`) file intended for LEGO Pybricks.
- Click on the "üöÄ Run on LEGO Brick" button at the top right corner.

The extension will execute:
```bash
pybricksdev run yourfile.py
```

## üåê Remote Workspace Support

This extension fully supports remote development environments including:

- **SSH Remote:** Connect to remote servers while programming locally
- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):** Develop in Linux while flashing from Windows
- **Dev Containers:** Work in containerized environments seamlessly

### How It Works

When you're using a remote workspace:

1. The extension automatically detects the remote environment
2. When you click "Run on Robot", it syncs **all Python files** from your remote workspace to your local machine's temp directory (`/tmp/pybricks-runner` on Mac/Linux or `%TEMP%\pybricks-runner` on Windows)
3. Directory structure is maintained, so **local imports work correctly**
4. Runs `pybricksdev` **locally** (not in the remote terminal) with the synced files
5. Your SPIKE Prime connects via Bluetooth to your local machine
6. Output appears in the **Pybricks Runner** sidebar under "Logs" (not in the terminal)

**Multi-File Projects Supported:**
If your project has multiple Python files with imports like:
```python
from pybricks.hubs import PrimeHub
from my_helpers import move_forward  # Local import
from utils.constants import SPEED    # Local import from subfolder
```
The extension automatically syncs all `.py` files while maintaining your project structure, so all imports work seamlessly!

**Note:** For local workspaces, output still appears in the integrated terminal as usual.

### Setup Requirements

**No additional setup required!** The extension handles everything automatically. Just ensure:

‚úÖ `pybricksdev` is installed on your **local machine** (where your laptop's Bluetooth is)
‚úÖ Your SPIKE Prime hub is paired with your **local machine**
‚úÖ Bluetooth is enabled on your **local machine**

The remote machine doesn't need pybricksdev installed since the extension runs locally.

### Supported Platforms

- ‚úÖ **Windows:** Full support (SSH, WSL, Dev Containers)
- ‚úÖ **macOS:** Full support (SSH, Dev Containers)
- ‚úÖ **Linux:** Full support (SSH, Dev Containers)

## üß© Troubleshooting

### **Error: 'pybricksdev: command not found'**

This means pybricksdev is not installed on your **local machine**. Follow these steps:

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Install pybricksdev
pip install pybricksdev

# Or with pip3
pip3 install pybricksdev

# Verify it's installed
pybricksdev --version
```

**On Windows:**
```cmd
# Install pybricksdev
pip install pybricksdev

# Or with python -m pip
python -m pip install pybricksdev

# Verify it's installed
pybricksdev --version
```

If still not working after installation:
- **macOS/Linux:** Check if Python's bin directory is in your PATH
- **Windows:** Restart VSCode after installation, or add Python Scripts folder to PATH
- See detailed installation instructions above

---

### **Robot not connecting**

- Ensure Bluetooth is enabled on your **local machine**
- Turn on your SPIKE Prime hub
- Run `pybricksdev devices` in terminal to check if the hub is detected
- Try re-pairing the hub via your OS Bluetooth settings

---

### **Remote Workspace Issues**

- Extension must run locally - check that `"extensionKind": ["ui"]` is set in package.json
- pybricksdev must be installed on your local machine, NOT the remote machine
- Check the "Pybricks Runner" sidebar "Logs" view for output when using remote workspaces

---

### **Web Bluetooth not available**

- Check if you're using a Chromium browser and have enabled the `chrome://flags/#enable-web-bluetooth` flag
- Web Bluetooth only works in secure contexts (HTTPS or localhost)


---

## Requirements

- Node.js LTS (18.x recommended)
- Python installed and configured (`pybricksdev`)
- Supported LEGO hardware (EV3, SPIKE Prime, etc.)

---

## ‚úÖ Web Bluetooth Setup for VSCode & code-server:

To enable Web Bluetooth:

1. **Open Chrome Flags**:  
   Go to `chrome://flags/#enable-web-bluetooth` and set it to **Enabled**.

2. **Use HTTPS or localhost**:  
   Web Bluetooth only runs in secure contexts.

3. **Browser Compatibility**:  
   Ensure you're using a Chromium-based browser (**Chrome, Edge**).

After enabling the flag, reload your VSCode web interface. Web Bluetooth functionality will then be available and reliable.


## üì¶ Manual Publishing (For Maintainers)

Since the GitHub workflow is currently not working, here's how to manually publish the extension to both marketplaces:

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following tokens:

1. **VS Code Marketplace Token (VSCE_TOKEN)**
   - Go to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/)
   - Create a Personal Access Token with `Marketplace (Manage)` scope
   - Organization: `All accessible organizations`

2. **Open VSX Token (OVSX_TOKEN)**
   - Go to [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/)
   - Sign in and generate a Personal Access Token

3. **GitHub Token (Optional for releases)**
   - Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
   - Generate token with `repo` scope

### Publishing Steps

#### 1. Update Version

```bash
# Update version in package.json
npm version patch  # or minor, or major
```

#### 2. Package the Extension

```bash
# Install vsce if not already installed
npm install -g @vscode/vsce

# Package the extension
vsce package
```

This creates a `.vsix` file like `pybricks-runner-0.3.1.vsix`

#### 3. Publish to VS Code Marketplace

```bash
# Using token directly
vsce publish -p YOUR_VSCE_TOKEN

# Or if token is in environment variable
vsce publish -p $VSCE_TOKEN
```

#### 4. Publish to Open VSX Registry

```bash
# Install ovsx if not already installed
npm install -g ovsx

# Publish using token
npx ovsx publish -p YOUR_OVSX_TOKEN

# Or if token is in environment variable
npx ovsx publish -p $OVSX_TOKEN
```

#### 5. Create GitHub Release (Optional)

```bash
# Create and push a git tag
git tag v0.3.1
git push origin v0.3.1

# Then manually create a release on GitHub:
# - Go to https://github.com/AnandSingh/pybricks-runner-vscode/releases/new
# - Select the tag you just created
# - Add release notes
# - Upload the .vsix file as an asset
# - Publish release
```

### Complete Publishing Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save this as publish.sh and run: chmod +x publish.sh && ./publish.sh

# Set your tokens (or load from environment)
VSCE_TOKEN="your-vsce-token-here"
OVSX_TOKEN="your-ovsx-token-here"

# Get current version from package.json
VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")

echo "üì¶ Packaging extension..."
vsce package

echo "üì§ Publishing to VS Code Marketplace..."
vsce publish -p $VSCE_TOKEN

echo "üì§ Publishing to Open VSX Registry..."
npx ovsx publish -p $OVSX_TOKEN

echo "üè∑Ô∏è  Creating git tag v$VERSION..."
git tag "v$VERSION"
git push origin "v$VERSION"

echo "‚úÖ Done! Don't forget to create a GitHub release manually."
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Authentication failed**: Check that your tokens are valid and have the correct scopes
- **Version already exists**: Update the version in `package.json` before publishing
- **Package not found**: Make sure `vsce package` completed successfully
- **Token expired**: Generate new tokens from the respective platforms
