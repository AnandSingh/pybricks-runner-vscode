# Pybricks Runner - Easy Installers

This folder contains simple installers to help you quickly set up pybricksdev on your computer.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### For macOS Users:
**Double-click** `install-macos.command`

### For Windows Users:
**Double-click** `install-windows.bat`

## What These Installers Do

Both installers will:

1. âœ… Check if Python 3 is installed on your computer
2. âœ… Create a dedicated virtual environment at `~/.pybricks-venv` (macOS) or `%USERPROFILE%\.pybricks-venv` (Windows)
3. âœ… Install pybricksdev and all its dependencies
4. âœ… Set up the environment so the Pybricks Runner extension can find it automatically
5. âœ… Create command wrappers so you can use `pybricksdev` from anywhere
